    - data formats (JSON CSV TSV etc.)
    - retrieving data with Python (web, file system, etc.)
* working with Python data management packages (pandas, numpy)
* (a taste of) data analysis
    - descriptive statistics
    - linear and logistic regression
    - decision trees and random forests
* data visualization and plotting with Matplotlib
* relational databases using SQL:
    - SQLite
    - relational database design
    - Entity/Relationship (ER) diagrams
    - normalization
    - SQL syntax
    - basic create/read/update/delete
    - JOINs

## Textbooks

The following books are all available for free online reading through the NYU library's [license](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276639&p=1845282) for Safari Books Online. (Here are some [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1baUVxqR8Y8QV7qyCXf087jBVqJA-EkjE7j6AJvr2yO4/edit?usp=sharing) from the NYU library on getting the NYU license to work in O'Reilly's apps for iOS and Android). They can also be purchased in hard copy.

## Grading
I plan to use the following breakdown for grading.

* 5% - In-Class Participation
* 35% - Homework
* 30% - Midterm Exam
* 30% - Final Exam

## In-Class Participation

I will be posting problems on Ed (see below) to be done during class.

You don't need to get these problems right, but you do need to try to do them, that is, post some answer, in order to get credit for class participation.

Credit will only be given for answers posted during class time. And if 
you post some answer to 75% of the problems I post, you will get full
credit for participation.

This is for two purposes: to make the class more interactive, and to
encourage attendance.

## Homework

There will be 5 to 6 assignments.

You get 10 grace days for assignment due dates, to be used as you choose. For instance, if you turn the first assignment in 2 days late, you will have 8 days left. The graders will track this for you. After you exhaust your late days, you lose 10% for each day late.

The grace day system is designed to handle any personal situations you have, like a religious celebration, a family gathering, a short illness, a lot of work from other classes, etc.

## Information about Ed
You should have been automatically signed up for the Ed discussion system. The link (also in Brightspace in the Content area$)
is https://edstem.org/us/courses/35997/discussion/

Ed is an online discussion forum system that is designed to make it easy to have conversations around code.  Using Ed you will be able to ask me, the course tutors or your fellow students questions about course content and homework assignments. So if you have a question about the course content that could be of interest to other students, please post your question to Ed rather than sending me or the course assistant an email. Both of us will monitor Ed and answer questions there. You can also feel free to answer questions yourself if you know the answer.

If you have a question for me that only concerns you (e.g. something about your grades), then feel free to send me an email. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via email or during office hours if you feel as though you are falling behind or you are not understanding a particular concept.

## Personal Computers and Software

It is highly encouraged that you bring a laptop to class. 

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) on your machine. We will be mainly using Google Colab notebooks in class which I will share with you. You can make your own copies of these notebooks and run and edit those copies online. However, you may want to run some notebooks locally on your machine. Anaconda installs JupyterLab on your machine which is what I recommend using for this. It also installs lot of other useful software.

## Disability Disclosure Statement
Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu) for further information. Students who are requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center as early as possible in the semester for assistance, although it can be done at any time during the semester.

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity
Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department [statement on academic integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) for more information.
