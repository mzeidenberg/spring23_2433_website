## Course Topics

Database system architecture. Modeling an application and logical database design. The relational model and relational data definition and data manipulation languages. Design of relational databases and normalization theory. Physical database design. Concurrency and recovery. Query processing and optimization.

## Textbook

The textbook is [Database System Concepts (7th edition) by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan.](https://www.db-book.com/)

We will be following the book rather closely so it is important that you obtain a copy. It is avaialble at the NYU 
Bookstore, on Amazon and other online booksellers, and in the Courant Library through electronic reserve.

## Grading
I plan to use the following breakdown for grading.

* 5% - Research Paper Presentation
* 5% - In-Class Participation
* 30% - Homework
* 30% - Midterm Exam
* 30% - Final Exam

## Research Paper Presentation

Each week except for the first, I will be asking a team of seven students to present an important paper from the database
research literature that I will select. The paper should be presented using at least seven slides and each student should present at least one slide. The presentation should take 10 to 15 minutes.

This will be ungraded, but required. That is, if you participate in a team, you will get the full five points for this activity.
You only need to do this once in the semester.

If you are very averse to public speaking, I will present your slide, but in that case you need to write up what you want me 
to say about the slide in a couple of a paragraphs.

## In-Class Participation

I will be posting problems on Ed (see below) to be done during class.

You don't need to get these problems right, but you do need to try to do them, that is, post some answer, in order to get credit for class participation.

Credit will only be given for answers posted during class time. And if 
you post some answer to 75% of the problems I post, you will get full
credit for participation.

This is for two purposes: to make the class more interactive, and to
encourage attendance.

## Homework

There will be 5 to 6 assignments.

You get 10 grace days for assignment due dates, to be used as you choose. For instance, if you turn the first assignment in 2 days late, you will have 8 days left. The graders will track this for you. After you exhaust your late days, you lose 10% for each day late.

The grace day system is designed to handle any personal situations you have, like a religious celebration, a family gathering, a short illness, a lot of work from other classes, etc.

## Information about Ed
You should have been automatically signed up for the Ed discussion system. The link (also in Brightspace in the Content area)
is https://edstem.org/us/courses/35999/discussion/

Ed is an online discussion forum system that is designed to make it easy to have conversations around code.  Using Ed you will be able to ask me, the course tutors or your fellow students questions about course content and homework assignments. So if you have a question about the course content that could be of interest to other students, please post your question to Ed rather than sending me or the course assistant an email. Both of us will monitor Ed and answer questions there. You can also feel free to answer questions yourself if you know the answer.

If you have a question for me that only concerns you (e.g. something about your grades), then feel free to send me an email. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via email or during office hours if you feel as though you are falling behind or you are not understanding a particular concept.

## Personal Computers and Software

It is highly encouraged that you bring a laptop to class. 

## Disability Disclosure Statement
Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu) for further information. Students who are requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center as early as possible in the semester for assistance, although it can be done at any time during the semester.

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity
Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department [statement on academic integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) for more information.
